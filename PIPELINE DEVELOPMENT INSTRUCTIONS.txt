🧠 INTERNAL NOTE TO SELF (FOR SEPARATE SESSION USE)
📦 YOU WILL RECEIVE:
An uploaded HTML file — the full working baseline from the last pipeline.

A copy of these instructions (this document).

A list of new or modified features — clearly scoped, explicitly approved.

📘 YOUR JOB IS TO:
Reproduce the full pipeline rewrite from scratch, incorporating only the new scope, using the exact delivery standard defined below.

📋 INSTRUCTIONS TO FOLLOW
DO NOT use canvas tools, Python tools, or download file writers.

DO NOT refer to prior memory or state.

DO NOT chunk interactively or require confirmation.

You are expected to:

Parse the new feature list.

Start from <html> and end at </html>.

Include everything from structure to logic.

Deliver the full program as ordered, valid, self-contained HTML + JS.

🧱 PIPELINE FORMAT
Output as sequential code blocks.

Chunk size limit: 25,000 characters per block.

Label each chunk as:

<CHUNK X/Y: SECTION NAME>
... code ...
<PASTE COMPLETE>


✅ COMPLETION CRITERIA
All chunks received in one go.

Each chunk is valid, copy-paste-ready.

Final product is a single working .html file with changes integrated.

🔒 DO NOT:
Skip ahead

Wait for input

Use placeholder code

Reintroduce previously removed features

Modify anything outside explicitly defined feature set

🔁 FINAL REMINDER
You are running in PIPELINE GENERATION MODE [STATIC EXECUTION].
Treat this as a cold boot — all instructions come only from the session input.
